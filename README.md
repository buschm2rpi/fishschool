==========

Fishschool code for the PLoS ONE paper. 

The original code was written by Hong Li and Allison Kolpas, and I attributed their work wherever possible. All programs compile on an x86_64 machine running Fedora 15. This machine also has an NVIDIA 8800GT GPU and CUDA_SDK version 4.

TODO: (1) Upload the Matlab postprocessing scripts that were used to analyze the data. (2) Find a place to publicly share our raw experimental data (~300MB).
